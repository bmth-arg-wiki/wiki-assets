[In the Dark MV Analysis]

## Intro

We see a screen with some code, most of it is CSS for styling or lower level code. The 
words contained within seem irrelevant. We do see "virus spreading". Additionally, 
flashes on the screen seem to contain code documentation.

## Man in the room

We then switch to a man in a bare room, sitting in a chair with a digital device on his 
right temple. Something else seems to be attached behind his left ear.
Before him are a set of screens. Since the room is so bare, they can very well be related 
to what is happening in his brain and his memories. The screens also show flashes of 
what we see happening in the video, indicating that they might be memories.

Theory: the man is Dallus Lauren, mentioned in the Trinity document and DUST document. 
He is undergoing the desensitization protocols (that do not work according to the DUST 
document) for his mares, which are referred to as induced psychological hallucinations. 
Desensitisation often involves repeated exposure, or in this case the reliving of his 
mares. They are also referred to as "cognitive echoes", which makes it sound more like 
all of these hallucinations might be related to real-life events.

The man has a tear running down his face and is emotionally distressed. He is the 
stand-in for Oli's voice and mouths the lyrics throughout the video.

## Mutations?

We see the first vague scene of what seems to be entities, possibly mutated, 
reaching out through what looks like partially see-through fabric. 
We see a thin creature with long arms and a tiny waist behind this fabric, as well as 
a pair of people. Sometimes the entities seem to scream.

## Two curly-haired girls

A little girl can be seen in the video, wearing tiny yellow and red extensions. She 
is holding drawings, before a monster takes her away. We also see her on the screens 
and "BAD SIGNAL" flashes over them before she disappears from the screen.

Theory: the little girl is Dallus' daughter, who seems to have inherited his power (DUST doc). 
She is taken away by the sleep demons they speak about in the same document.

Around 0:42 we see a girl holding a sparkler. Her hair is dark and very curly, 
the background is greenish and she is partially obscured by purple light. Later in the 
video we see her again with different lighting.

Theory: she could be Dallus' daughter, but the actress looks a little older.

## The woman in the suit

We also see shots of a woman in a suit, she appears to be wearing a little handcuff earring 
and is smoking a cigarette.

Theory: she is Rebecca, the first synth. She is smoking a cigarette, which is a marketing 
ploy by Nex Gen to show that synth bodies are resistant. Her face and hair look similar too. 
Her signature earring, however, is not shown in the Tekka magazine cover or interview. 
Rebecca may also appear at the cyborg rave later in T10STCB.

## Lab experiments

### nr. 2 Altilium Chordata Tank

There is a tank with 'altilium chordata' on it, same as described in the DUST document, 
although the number two is missing on the device in that document. According to that document, 
it puts the body in metastasis and prevents the release of endorphins that can disturb the 
outcome of the project. It is also suggested to have healing properties. In the document 
a version 2 of this tank is proposed.

First we see a woman, possibly in metastasis in the tank. Later in the video, she turns 
towards the camera and moving around in the tank. Eventually we see a tank filled with 
bloody water, bloody footsteps leading away from the tank and what looks like a piece 
of skin over the edge of the tank. There is more unidentifiable (possibly biological) 
matter left in the tank.

Theory: we are seeing the second version of this tank, indicated by the 2 on the side. 
The experiment was not a success and produced Angeldust.

we have many shots of a hand in reddish water, which is still somewhat transparent. Likely 
refers to the bloody water in the altilium chordata tank.

### nr. 6 Plant corollary

We get several shots of a man sitting on the floor of a room. His back is turned towards us and
lights up orange along the spine, with wires crossing his back. He is in front of a 
large planter that contains blue-ish sharp edged flowers.

## Misc. scenes

There's a scene of fireworks, with a man and a woman in front of it. A quick flash on the 
screen says "CODE EXPANDING". After this we see a quick flash of a car crash, with another 
shot of the fireworks following.

There are shots of a man burning, he has dreads and his smile seems to distort.

There is a shot of Oli with the number 0005 in this video, even though he does not appear 
as a main character.

Flashes of sunflowers, like we've seen before in Amen and Ludens stage visuals.
